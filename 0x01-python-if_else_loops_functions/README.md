# Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this endeavor, I commenced applying conditionals and loops in the Python programming language. I utilized constructs such as if statements, if ... else clauses, as well as keywords like break, continue, and pass, in conjunction with the range function within both while and for loops. Furthermore, I honed my skills in crafting custom Python functions, all the while gaining insights into variable scopes, tracebacks, and the manipulation of arithmetic operators.
