# 0x0A-python-inheritance

This project is based on Inheritance (OOP) in Python.
In this project, I learned about Python class inheritance. I learned about the differences between super- and sub-classes while practicing inheritance, definining classes with multiple base classes, and overiding inherited methods and attributes.

There are a total of 14 tasks in the project:
12 mandatory tasks and 2 advanced tasks.
